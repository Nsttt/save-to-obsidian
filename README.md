# PayCheck for Twitter

tl;dr - I made an extension that (poorly) estimates how much money a tweet is worth

[Now on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/paycheck-for-twitter/ldgffedhocinnolmaaecnppdfmmofilp)

# HOW TO INSTALL MANUALLY

1. Download latest .zip from [releases](https://github.com/t3dotgg/paycheck-extension/releases)
2. Unzip the file
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click "Load unpacked"
6. Select the folder you unzipped
7. Copilot wrote these instructions for me so I hope they're good enough
